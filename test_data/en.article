Johnson role divides opinion among leaders and diplomats
Boris Johnson has promised to reshape Britain as a “great global player” as he entered the Foreign Office, but some European politicians reacted to his appointment with dismay.
Mr Johnson said that he had discussed post-Brexit Britain with John Kerry, the US secretary of state. “What he really wants to see, and I think this is the right thing, is more Britain abroad, a greater global profile,” said Mr Johnson.
The appointment of one of the architects of the Brexit campaign as the face of Britain overseas caused knee-jerk astonishment across Europe, but there was relief from other quarters that political stability is returning to the UK after several weeks of chaos.
Sir Peter Ricketts, who served as permanent secretary to the Foreign Office and ambassador to France, told the BBC that diplomats would “adapt to him very quickly” if Mr Johnson “shows he can knuckle down and channel that huge energy he has”.
Mr Johnson proved a successful and energetic ambassador for London during his time as mayor, embarking on a series of overseas trips to drum up investment.
In France, Jean-Marc Ayrault, foreign minister, said he needed a “clear, credible, trustworthy partner” to negotiate a Brexit. “I am not at all worried about Boris Johnson, but . . . during the campaign he lied a lot to the British people and now it is he who has his back against the wall,” he added.
Mr Johnson’s campaigning before the referendum could lead to awkwardness around the table when he arrives in Brussels. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, said: “Their feelings would be fairly obvious. If you want to establish a relationship of trust with EU leaders it’s an uphill struggle of Olympic proportions.”
Stressing the need for deep links with Britain, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel said she had invited Theresa May, Britain’s new prime minister, to Berlin. “I think that our task is to co-operate very closely with the governments of friendly countries,” the chancellor said.
Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, said Britain would need time to work out the relationship it wanted with the EU. “We must let Her Majesty’s new government have a bit of time to make the necessary decisions,” Mr Schäuble said. But he added: “It’s also important to point out that the quicker we succeed in creating clarity, the better it is to limit possible risks.”
Mr Schäuble was speaking alongside Jack Lew, US Treasury secretary, who said it would be best for Britain and the world “to end up with a result which produces a highly integrated relationship between the UK and the EU”.
Both men suggested that foreign leaders would be quick to put aside Mr Johnson’s behaviour in campaign mode now that he has taken up office.
In India, there was hope that promises of more trade with Britain would materialise.
“If you look at most of his writings during the Brexit campaign, there is always a strong thrust about how Britain can improve its trading partnerships with countries like India,” said Swapan Dasgupta, an MP in India’s upper house.
“Britain will be able to have a greater commitment to its relations with India once the economic constraints of the EU are removed.”
In China, Mr Johnson is seen as “unconventional and unorthodox”, according to Victor Gao, who once served as translator to Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader. There was also some concern at the exit, from British politics, of David Cameron and particularly George Osborne, who had enthusiastically courted Beijing.
In Turkey, however, a sexually explicit limerick Mr Johnson once wrote about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not been forgotten.
“May God help him and reform him, and I hope he will not make any more mistakes and that he tries to make it up with the Turks,” said Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.
