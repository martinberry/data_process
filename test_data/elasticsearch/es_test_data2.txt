In Giray’s account, Ulukaya allegedly met a former Fage employee in Europe and paid him €30,000 ($41,109. Chobani is reportedly in talks to sell a stake to private-equity firm TPG.", "While Giray had asked a judge to order Chobani not to proceed with any capital-raising efforts that would reduce her alleged stake, the judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order today. In a statement, Chobani said it was pleased with the judge’s decision and described Giray’s claims as ”completely baseless and without merit.”", "Could there be a connection between the recipes used by Fage and Chobani? A Bloomberg Businessweek feature story last year noted that Chobani uses three cups of milk for a cup of yogurt, compared to four at Fage.  A look at the ingredients used today shows a small difference. For instance, Chobani low-fat plain yogurt is made from lowfat yogurt and the live, active cultures “S. Thermophilus, L. Bulgaricus, L. Acidophilus, Bifidus and L. Casei.” Fage 2 percent yogurt is made from Grade A pasteurized skimmed milk and cream and the same live, active cultures.", "Fage kicked off the Greek yogurt craze in the U.S. Back in 2007. Before the Greek yogurt boom, Dannon and Yoplait held 71 percent of the overall U.S. yogurt market, with only 2 percent of sales going to Greek-style products (mostly Fage’s). Chobani has become the second-largest yogurt brand and top-selling Greek yogurt, while Fage has fallen behind."], "date": "2014-04-04T20:54:23.016Z", "structured_content": {"publication_date": "2014-04-04T20:54:23.016Z", "title": "A Lawsuit Claims Chobani Stole a Yogurt Recipe From Fage", "author": "Venessa Wong"}, "categories": ["finance", "news"]}

This jarred with the suspension of Golding for the unauthorized share deal, she said.", "“I am mindful of the briefing that Yunis Shaik gave me when he claimed that Sactwu, a significant shareholder in HCI, had lost patience with the editorial practices of e.tv, citing the failure to give prominent coverage to Minister Ebrahim Patel’s economic pronouncements,” Hogan wrote in the letter.", "Hosken denied Golding’s allegations of media political interference in a statement today. The company said it had been “vindicated” by the labor court’s decision and the disciplinary proceedings would continue.", "Hogan didn’t immediately respond to phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment. Shaik didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone.", "Following Shaik’s briefing on Sactwu’s political agenda the union “refused to approve” the separation of Hosken’s media assets, including e.tv, from the rest of the company, Hogan said. The subsequent suspension of Golding and the probe into the Ellies share deal were conducted in an “unprofessional” manner, she said, citing as an example his removal as CEO of Hosken unit Sabido without informing shareholder Remgro Ltd.", "Hosken shares declined 0.3 percent to 149.50 rand at the close in Johannesburg, after falling 2 percent on Oct. 24.
